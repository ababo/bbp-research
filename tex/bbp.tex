\title{Efficient Backpropagation for XOR-OR networks}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Boolean neural networks offer hardware-efficient alternatives to real-valued models. While quantization is common, purely Boolean training remains underexplored, often relying on quantized real-valued backpropagation. We present a practical method for purely Boolean backpropagation in XOR-OR gate networks, operating directly in Boolean algebra without floating-point operations. Experiments confirm its viability for hardware-efficient implementations."
